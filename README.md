<h1 align=center>Tip Time app</h1>

This app is a great tool capable to calculate the tip on a bill according to the satisfaction 
of the customers. This is an app made with the Google Codelab called ["Getting user input data"](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-1?hl=pt-br), which contains 3 pathways driving you to knowledgement.

This codelab introduces you to a lot of concepts about the recommended programming language to create apps, some particularities about the Android SDK and its various elements.

## With this app, you can:

* Input the cost of service provided
* Add tip according to your satisfaction with the provided service
* Round up the tip
* Get the tip based on your settings and the final cost of service added with the tip


## Preview of the App
(soon)

## Technologies used

Since this app is a part of my study plan to become an native Android Developer, the tech stack is straight forward to pure native development.

* Kotlin 
* Android SDK
